        "- in oop, an object is a fundamental component that represent a real world entity or concept.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. what is difference between abstraction and encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "- encapsulation hides variable or some implimentation that may be changed so often in a class to prevent outsiders access it directly. they must access it via getter and setter method.\n",
        "abstraction is used to hide something too, but in a higher degree(class,interface). clients who use an abstract class do not care about what it was ,they just need to know what it can do.\n",

        "5. what are dunder methon in python.\n",
        "\n",
        "- dunder methods, also known as magic methods or speicel methods, are predefined methods in python that have double underscores(or \"dunders\") at the beginning and end of their names.\n",

        "6. explain the concept of inheritance in oop.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- polymorphism in oop is the ability of an object to take on many forms.\n",
        "it allows method to be written to work with objects of different classes, which can be treated as instances of a commom superclass. this is commonly achived through inheritance,where a child class can override methods of its parent class enabling different behaviour based on the specific object type.\n",

        "8. how is encapsulation achived in python.\n",
        "\n",
        "- encapsulation in python is achived through the use of access modifiers and getter and setter methods.\n",
        "variable and methods in python can be made private,protected,or public although python does not enforce these access levels strictly. instead it relies on naming convention : private variables and methods are prefixed with double underscore (_) protected variable and methods are prefixed with a single underscore (_) and public variable and methods do not have any special prefix.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. what is a constructor in python .\n",
        "\n",
        "- in python, a constructor is a speicel method named _init_ that is called automatically when an object is created from a class . it is used to intilized the object's attributes or state setting up it intial values.\n",

        "10. what are class and static method in python.\n",
        "\n",
        "- in python, class methods and static methods are both defined within a class but serve different purposes and have distinct characterstics.\n",
        "a class method is a method that is bound to the class itself,defined with the @classmethod decorator. it receives cls as the first argument,representing the class,and can access and modified class level data . class methods are often are used for operations that modify or interact with class level data, such as factory method that return class object for different use casees.\n",
        "a static method ,on the other hand ,is defined with the @staticmethod decorator and does not receive an implicit first argument(self or cls). static method can not access or modify class or instance attributes. they are typically used for utility functions that don't depend on the state of object such as formatting dates or performing mathematically operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. what is method overloading in python.\n",
        "\n",
        "- method overloading in python refers to the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter in a class . however, python does not directly support method overloading like some other languages like jave or c++. instead developers can simulate method overloading by using default arguments,variable length arguments(*args,**kwargs) or condition logic within a single method.\n",

        "12. what is method overriding in oop.\n",
        "\n",
        "- method overriding in oop occurs when a child classdefines a methods with a same name and parameters as a method in its parent class,allowing the child class to provide a specific implementaion of that method.\n",

        "13. what is a property decorator in python.\n",
        "\n",
        "- in python, the property decorator is a built in decorator that allows you to define methods as a properties of class.this means you can access these methods as if the were attributes,without needing to call them as function.\n",

        "14. why is polymorphism important in oop.\n",
        "\n",
        "-  polymorphism in python oop allows objects of different classes to be treated\n",
        "   interchangeably if they share method names,promoting code flexibility and reuseability. it simplifies maintaining and extending code by letting you write generic functions that work with multiple types,reduce redundency, and aligns with python's dynamic,readable design.for example, a speak() method in dog and cat classes can be called uniformly, avoiding rigid type checks. this makes systems modular and adaptable.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. what is abstract class in python.\n",
        "\n",
        "- in python, an abstract class is a class that can not be instantiated and contains one or more abstract methods without defined implementation. abstract classes provide a blueprint for other classes,enforcing a common structure while allowing derived classes to provide concrete implimentaion for the abstract methods.\n",

        "- polymorphism: flexible method behavior accross objects.\n",
        "- abstraction: simplify complexity with high level interfaces.\n",
        "- maintainability: easier to debug and update structured code.\n",
        "- readability: model real world logic intuitively.\n",

        "\n",
        "18. what is multiple inheritance in python.\n",
        "\n",
        "- multiple inheritance in python is a feature where a class can inherit attributes and methods for more than one parent class. this allows a child class to combine behaviours or attributes from multiple other classes,which can be quite powerful. for example,if you have a video class and a audio class,you can create a multimedia class that inherits from both ,combining their functionalitis.\n",

        "\n",
        "- in python, the --str-- methods is used to provide a human-readable string representaion of an object,intended for display to users, it is called automatically when the object is printed or passed to the str() function.\n",

        "\n",
        "- the super() function in python significant because it allows a subclass toherit and extend the behaviour of its parent class while providing flexibility to override or extend that behavior in the subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. what is significance of the __del__ method in python.\n",
        "\n",
        "- the __del__ method in python is a destructor method that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. it allows you to define specific cleanup actions that should be taken when an object is garbage collected, such as closing files,releasing locks,or closing network connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. what is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in python.\n",
        "\n",
        "- decorator: @staticmethod is used to define a static method,while @classmethod is used to define a class method.\n",
        "-first arguments: @staticmethod does not receive any implicit first argument,whereas @classmethod receives the class itself (cls) as the first argument.\n",
        "-access: @staticmethod can only access class-level attributes and other static methods,but not instance-level attributes. @classmethod can access class-level attributes and other class methods,but not instance level attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. how does polymorphism work in python with inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "- in python,polymorphism with inhertance allows child classes to override parent methods.when a method is called on an object,python uses the method from the object's class if defined,otherwise,it uses the parent's. this enables different classes to share the same method name with varying implementation.\n",

        "24. what is method chaining in python oop.\n",
        "\n",
        "- method chaining in python is a technique used in object-oriented programming where multiple methods of same object are called in succession,each method returning the object itself to allow further method calls to be chained together.this pattern enhances code readability and conciseness by eliminating the need for inter midiate variable or repeated methods call.\n",

        "25. what is the purpose of the __call__method in python.\n",
        "\n",
        "-in python,the __call__ method allows instances of a class to be called like functions. when defined, calling an object using parentheses triggers the __call__ method,enabling more flexible and reuseable code.this method can take arguments and return values,and it can also cause side effects,making the instances of the class behaver like functions.\n",
