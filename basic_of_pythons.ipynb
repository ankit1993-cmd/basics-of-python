        "# basic of python\n",
        "1. what is python? and why is it popular\n",
        "   - python is high level,inerpreted,general purpose programming language created by Guido van rossum 1991.\n",
        "   it supports multiple programming paradigms,including procedural,object oriented and functional programming key feautre includes\n",
        "    - dynamically typed\n",
        "    -extensive standard library\n",
        "    - cross platform compatibility\n",
        "    - open source\n",
        "   - why is it popular ?\n",
        "    - beginner friendly\n",
        "    -versatility\n",
        "    -rich ecosystem\n",
        "    -strong community and support\n",
        "    -demand in emerging fields\n",
        "    -integration and extensibilty\n",
        "    -corporate adoption\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. what is an interpreter in python ?\n",
        "   - an interpreter in python is a programthat reads and executes python code line by line translating it into machine understandable instructions on the fly . unlike complied languages (c,c++) python does not require code to be fully converted to machine code before execution . instead the interpreter processes instruction sequentially making it easier to debug and test cod e interavtively\n",
        "\n",
        " 3. what are predefined keywords in python ?\n",
        "    - keywords are reserved words in python with speicel meanings .\n",
        "      they can not be used as variable names,function names, or identifiers. python has 35 keywords (as a python 3.9)\n",
        "\n",
        " 4. can keywords be used as variable name ?\n",
        "    - no, we can not use keyword as variable name because keywords are reserved words in python and they have specific meaning.\n",
        "\n",
        " 5. what is mutability in python ?\n",
        "   - mutability in python refers to whether an object can be modified after it is created.\n",
        "   this concept is to fundamental to understanding how data is handeled in python\n",
        "   mutabilty means an object can be changed in place after creation\n",
        "\n",
        " 6. why are lists are mutables,but tuples are immutable ?\n",
        "   - lists are mutable to support dynamic data (e.g. adding/removing items).tuples are immutable to ensurev data safety ,allow use as dictionary keys,and optimize memory / performance . use lists for modifiable collections, tuples for fixed data\n",
        "\n",
        " 7. what is difference between \"==\" and \"is\" operators in python?\n",
        "   - \"==\" checks value equality(same content)\n",
        "     \"is\" checks identity(same objects in memory)\n",
        "     use \"is\" for None,True,False.\n",
        "     use \"==\" to compare values\n",
        "\n",
        " 8. what are logical operators in python ?\n",
        "   - there are three types of logical operator in python\n",
        "    and= True if both operands are True(5>3 and 5<10)----True\n",
        "    or= True if atleast one operand is true(5>3 or 5<2)----True\n",
        "    not= inverts the boolean value not(5<3)----True\n",
        "\n",
        " 9. what is type casting in python ?\n",
        "    - type casting converts one data type to another explicitly\n",
        "    int(): converts to integers.\n",
        "    float(): converts to float.\n",
        "    str(): converts to string.\n",
        "\n",
        " 10. what is difference between implicit and explicit type casting ?\n",
        "    - in implicit type casting, the programming language automatically converts data types to another if needed. for example if you have an integer variable and you try to assign it to a f;loat variable, the programming language automatically converts the inetgers to a float without you having to do anythiong.\n",
        "    other hand explicit type casting, also known as type coeration,occurs when the programmer explicitly converts a value from one data type to another\n",
        "    unlike implicit type casting, explicit type casting requires the programmer to specify the desierd data type conversion.\n",
        "\n",
        " 11. what is the purpose of conditional statement in python ?\n",
        "    - in python, conditional statement are used to execute certain blocks of code based on specific condition, helping to control the flow of a program and make it behave differently in different situation\n",
        "    these statement allow the program to react differently depending on whether a condition is True or False\n",
        "    common condition statement in python include \"if\" \"elif\" and \"else\", whioch enable the selection of specific blocks of code to execute based on condition.\n",
        "\n",
        " 12. how does the elif statement works in python ?\n",
        "    - in python, the elif statement, which stands for \"else if\", is used to check multiple condition sequentially. if the first condition is false python moves on the next elif statement to check if that condition is true . if none of the conditions are true, the code will execute the else statement if it exist.\n",
        "    the structure of an \"if elif else\" statement as follow-\n",
        "    if condition 1:\n",
        "        execute code if condition 1 is true\n",
        "    elif condition2:\n",
        "        execute code if condition 2 is true\n",
        "    else:\n",
        "        execute code if all conditions are false\n",
        "\n",
        "  13. what is difference between for and while loop ?\n",
        "      - for loop iterates over sequence(list,strings etc) or fixed iteration. use when you know the number of loops upfront\n",
        "      - syntax-\n",
        "       for i in range(3):\n",
        "         print(i)\n",
        "\n",
        "      - while loop runs while a condition is true . use for unknown iteration (e.g waiting for user input)\n",
        "      - syntax-\n",
        "      count=0\n",
        "      while count < 3:\n",
        "         print(count)\n",
        "         count+= 1\n",
        "\n",
        "   14. describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop ?\n",
        "       - a while loop is more suitable than for loop when the number of iteration is unknown and depends on a dynamic condition that may change during execution.\n",
        "       example- user input validation\n",
        "       you want repeatedly prompt a user until they enter a valid input (e.g. a positive number).\n",
        "\n",
        "       valid= False\n",
        "       while not valid:\n",
        "           user_input= input(\"enter a positive number:\")\n",
        "           if user_input.isdigit() and int (user_input) > 0:\n",
        "           valid=True\n",
        "           else:\n",
