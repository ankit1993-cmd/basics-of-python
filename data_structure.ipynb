        "\n",
        "1. what are data structure? and why they are imporatant ?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - data structure are a way of organizing data so that it can be accessed more efficiently depending upon the situation.\n",
        "   dat structure are fundamentals of any programming language.around which a program is built .python helps to learn the fundamentals of these data structure in a simpler way as compared to other programming language.\n",
        "   -mutable: list,dict,set\n",
        "   - immutable: tuple,frozenset\n",
        "   - specialized: collections,deque,heapq,defaultdict,namedtuple\n",
        "   - third-party: Numpy arrays,pandas,datframes\n",
        "\n",
        "2. explain the difference between immutable and mutable data types with example.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - in python, data types categorized into mutable and immutable types.\n",
        "   mutable data types are those whose all values can be changed after they are created.while immutable data types value that can not be changed after they are created .\n",
        "   - mutable data types:\n",
        "    lists- lists are mutable and can be changed in place. for example we can append,remove,or insert elements into a list .\n",
        "    dictionary- dictionary are mutable can be updated by adding,removing,or changing key-value pairs .\n",
        "    - immutable data types:\n",
        "    tuples- tuples are immutable and can not change their value after created.\n",
        "    strings- string are also immutable\n",
        "    mutable object can be used when flexibility and changes are required , whereas immutable objects are useful when atability and consistancy are needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. what are main difference between list and tuples ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - in python, list and tuple both store collection of data, but differ in mutability,performance and memory uses .list are mutable allowing modification\n",
        "  ,while tuple are immutable .choosing between them depends on whether you need to modify the data of prioritize performance and memory efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. discribe how dictionaries stores data ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - dictionaries in python store data as key valuse pairs using hash table structure:\n",
        "   -keys are hashed to determine their storage index.\n",
        "   -values are stored at these cmputed indexes for 0(1) average time lookups.\n",
        "   -collisions are resolved via open adderessing.\n",
        "   -insertion order is preserved maintained via auxiliry array.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. why might you use a set instead of a list in python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - in python,you might choose a set over a list in the following scenarios:\n",
        "  1. to ensures unique element\n",
        "  -sets automatically remove all duplicates.\n",
        "  -list allow repeted values.\n",
        "  2. faster memberships checks\n",
        "  -sets use hash table for 0(1). average time membership checks.\n",
        "  -list requires 0(n)nlinear scan.\n",
        "  3. mathematical set operations\n",
        "  -set supports unions,intersections,differences etc.\n",
        "  -lists do not .\n",
        "  4. orderer does'nt matter\n",
        "  -sets are unorderd\n",
        "  -list maintain insertion order.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. what is string in python,and how is it different from list ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - in python,a string and a list are both orderd collections,but they served different purpose and have key difference:\n",
        "  1. string: a sequence of unicode characters enclose in quotes(' ',\" \",\"\"\" \"\"\")\n",
        "     sring is also immutable\n",
        "     represent and manipulate textual data.\n",
        "  2. list: a mutable,ordered collection of heterogeneous elements,enclosed in square brackets([])\n",
        "  list can be modified\n",
        "  store and manage dynamic collections of items.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. how do tuples ensure data integrity in python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - tuples in python, ensure data inegrity through their immutability-once created, their elements can not be modified,added,or remove .this makes them ideal for scenarios where data shouls remain fixed and unaltered .\n",
        "\n",
        "8. what is hash table,and how does it relate to dictionaries in python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - a hash table is a data structure that organizes data for quick access by transforming a key into an index through a process called hashing,which allows for average time complexity of 0(1) for lookups,insertion,and deletion,making it extreamely efficient. in python dictionaries are built in data type that stores data in key:value format and they are impliment using hash table.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. can list contains different types of data in python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - in python,a list can indeed contain different types of data . each item in the list is seperated by commas and entire list is enclosed in square brackets ([])\n",
        "   this flexibility allows you to include strings,integers,floating-point values. and even boolean values within the same list.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. explain why are string immutable in python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - the immutability of strings in python is enforced by the language design to ensure the string remains consistent and prevent accidental modification\n",
        "    this is particularly useful in multithreading environment where changes of string could lead to unpredictable behaviour.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. what advantages do dictionaries offer over a list for certain task ?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - dictionaries offer several advantages over list for certain task primarly due to their key-values structure. one major advantage is th ability to access elements by their keys rather tham their poition ,which allows for efficient and fast retrivel of values based on specific key.this is particularly useful when dealing with large data sets and when the order of elemenmt is not important. additionally ,dictionaries are implemented as hash table,which provide fast access to values based on their keys ,making them faster than lists for element retrivel.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list .\n",
        "\n",
        "   - using a tuple is preferable over a list in scenario where data integrity and immutability are crucial.\n",
        "   for example ,consider a database record where each field conatains a specific piece of information that should not be change throughout the program execution . a tuple can represent such a record effectively because it ensures the data remains constant,preventing accidental modification that could corrupt the data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. how do sets handle duplicate values in python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - in python,sets automatically handle duplicate values by ensuring each element is unique.here's how they manage duplicates\n",
        "    1. uniqueness enforcement- when you attempt to add duplicate values to set ignores the duplicates.only one instance of each unique element is retained.\n",
        "    2. sets use hash tables for storage .when adding an element,python first compute its hash (via **hash**) to locate a storage bucket.\n",
        "    3. if multiple elements share the same hash(collision),python checks equality (via **eq**) to confirm if they are truely duplicates.\n",
        "    4. sets are unordered,so the original insertion order is not preserved.\n",
        "    5. element must be immutable and hashable.mutable can not be added to sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. how does the \"in\" keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - in python, \"in\" keyword checks memberships,but it behaves differently for list and dictionariesbased on their underlying structure .\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. for lists\n",
        "  - checks for value:\n",
        "    the in keyword scans the list to see if a value exists in list.\n",
        "    -time complexity: 0(n) (linear search).\n",
        "    example:\n",
        "    my_list = [10,20,30]\n",
        "    print(20 in my list)\n",
        "    print(40 in my list)\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. for dictionaries\n",
        "  - checks for keys:\n",
        "  the in keyword checks if a key exists in the dictionaries.\n",
        "  -time complexity: 0(1) due to hash table lookups\n",
        "  example:\n",
        "  my_dict = {'a':1,'b':2,'c':3}\n",
        "  print('b' in my dict)\n",
        "  print(2 in myu dict)\n",
        "\n",
        "15. can you modify the elements of a tuple ? explain why or why not ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - in python, you can not directly modify the element because tuples are immutable.once a tuple is created , its element can not be changed,added,removed. however ,you can simulate the modification of tuple elements by converting the tuples to a list,making the neccesary changes ,and then converting it back to tuple.\n",
        "\n",
        "  original_tuple = (10,20,30,40,50)\n",
        "  tuple_list = list(original_tuple)\n",
        "  index_to_update = 2\n",
        "  new_value = 35\n",
        "  tuple_list[index_to_update] = new_value\n",
        "  update_tuple = tuple(tuple_list)\n",
        "\n",
        "16. what is nested dictionary ,and give an example of its use case ?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - a nested dictionary is a dictionary that contains another dictionary as its value, allowing for a hierarchical structure to organize and manage data more effeciently. this structure is particularly useful for representing complex data relationship,such as in the example where a family structure is represented with children's details.\n",
        "   for example, a nested dictionary can be used to represent a family structure where each child is a dictionary containing their name and birth year\n",
        "\n",
        "   my_family = {\n",
        "    \"child1\": {\"name\":\"email\",\"year\":2004},\n",
        "    \"child2\": {\"name\":\"tobias\",\"year\":2007},\n",
        "    \"child3\": {\"name\":\"linus\",\"year\":2011},\n",
        "   }\n",
        "\n",
        "17. describe the time complexity of accessing element in dictionary .\n",
        "\n",
        "   - python dictionaries provide a fast and effecient way tyo store and retrieve data using key value pair so understanding the time complexity of dictionary operations is very important for optimizing performance in our program.\n",
        "   accessing elements by key (0(1))\n",
        "   the time complexity of retriving a value by its key. in a dictionary is 0(1)\n",
        "   this is because dictionaries use a hash table internally which allows constant time lookup.\n",
        "\n",
        "   dict = {'a':1,'b':2,'c':3}\n",
        "   val = dict['b']\n",
        "   print(val)\n",
        "\n",
        "18. in what situation are lists preferred over dictionaries ?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - in python,lists and dictionaries serve different purposes and choosing between them depends on the specific use case .\n",
        "   1. when order is matter\n",
        "   2. when index based access is required\n",
        "   3. when duplicates are allowed\n",
        "   4. memory effeciency\n",
        "   5. stack or queue operations\n",
        "   6. iteration without key lookups\n",
        "\n",
        "19. why are dictionaries considerd unorderd,and how does that affect data retrival ?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - dictionaries are considerd unorderd because they do not maintain aspecific order of the items based on when they are added,which allows for faster key-based access rather than sequential order.\n",
        "   this unorderd nature affects data retrival by allowing dictionaries to provide constant time complexity for insertion,deletion,and lookups on average.\n",
